<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I am not content with my current environment. The roses are red and the water is blue but the sky is an ugly reddish-green and I cannot decipher up from down as the sky is not where it normally is. There is only one explanation for this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoHD9XEInc0">Inception.</a></p>
<p>And so I'd like to say: Hello World.</p>
